## About The Project

India is predominantly an agricultural country. Farming is a major occupation in India and one of the biggest 
challenges which comes when a huge workforce is occupied is that it becomes very difficult to provide 
personal attention to every farmer. To help the farmers improve in agricultural sector, we propose a web-based application "कृषि Unnati". 
Through the web-app we provide online tele-consultation services as well as offline alternatives for consultation to farmers. They can get support in various agricultural activities, by the help of consultants as well as connect with their peers through the web app. 

## Top Features

1. Simple UI- KrishiUnnati is aimed to assist the entire farmer population of India through a very easy to understand and convenient layout.


2. Plant Identification-The system identifies the plant from the image and analyzes its health. Response includes : Plant's name and details, Possible disease & their description, Remedies/cures for the disease


3. Voice Asssistant- In case a farmer has difficulty using the website they can use the voice assistant to navigate the website. They just need to say the the name of the page where they want to go and our voice assistant will take the farmer there.


4. Multilingual- Website is available in English, Hindi and other regional languages. The users can easily switch the language of the entire website using the options in the homepage.
